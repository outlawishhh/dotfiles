# Kriti-shell
This is Kriti-shell. It has many features I have not seen in other configs of any widget system, like built in _**LYRICS**_!

[Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7NS3uAZfyI) since it is too long to upload directly in github.

## Notable features
### Media player with synced lyrics

The media player automatically loads lyrics from lrclib. Also works with local files with correct metadata. 

You can also search for lyrics, if Kriti-shell does not automatically find them.

## Known issues
### ~~Media length not updated correctly when using browser based players~~ 
> [!Note]
> Seems entirely fixed now when using Firefox.

This issue is currently addressed with a setting in `settings.json` called `"resetPositionOnTrackChange"`, but that has the issue that you may lose saved progress on media when switching to another tab with media.

### ~~Media position not updated correctly when using browser based players~~ 
> [!Note]
> Seems mostly fixed now when using Firefox.

This issue is also currently addressed with a setting in `settings.json` called `"saveLoadPositionOnPlayPause"`, but that has the issue that play/pause feels a little janky because it snaps back to the start of the current second.

## Updating

> [!Note]
> It is recommended to update Kriti-shell when you update Quickshell. If there are any breaking bugs from Quickshell updates, please make an issue!
>
> The new settings get automatically mergred into your settings.json non-destructively.

Run this in the installation folder (usually `.config/quickshell/Kriti-shell`):
```sh
git pull
```

## Installation

1. Install quickshell. For Arch:

   ```sh
   pacman -S quickshell
   ```

2. Make sure you have installed: `curl` (and optionally: `pw-volume`)
3. Clone this repo into `.config/quickshell/Kriti-shell`
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SolarPunchGames/Kriti-shell/ ~/.config/quickshell/Kriti-shell
   ```

5. Add `exec-once qs -c Kriti-shell` to your hyprland.conf (You can also run once from the terminal with `qs -c Kriti-shell`)
6. Add `bind = SUPER, SPACE , exec, qs -c Kriti-shell ipc call appMenu toggle` to your hyprland.conf (edit keybind, if needed)
7. Add `windowrulev2 = float, class:org.quickshell` to your hyprland.conf
8. Profit.

## Editing settings

The settings can be found in the installation folder as `settings.json` after first launch. A graphical interface is planned.

If you want to reset to default settings, remove settings.json. Kriti-shell will ask you to copy defaults back.

*Multi choice settings have the value as a number. Remember that the values start from 0, so the first choice is 0 and the second is 1 and so on.

## Ipc calls

You can use these for example to make keybinds for Kriti-shell.

Usage:
```sh
qs -c Kriti-shell ipc call <<target>> <<function>>
```

Targets and functions:
* appMenu
	* toggle
